## Design Patterns

</div>

**Maintainability** - I have tried to keep components modular and scalable and dynamic, with an emphasis on reusability and readability.

**Server fetching and formatting** - I am handling fetching and formatting of data on the backend, allowing for tsx components to render data without unnecessary logic or formatting on the front end. I have achieved this by creating dynamic helper functions that process and reformat the data.

**Dynamic fetch function** - I have created two highly flexible server functions to handle all the data fetching necessary for the application.

**Type Safety** - The use of types and interfaces is constant throughout the app, without a single use of the word 'any' to override the type check.

**File and folder structure** - The app is organised to seperate components based on their role, as well as separating types, utils, server functions and constants.

**Saving and committing work often** - I regularly made commits and pull requests to github using a total of 36 pull requests with clear commit messages. This keeps the project organised and allows me to work on tasks without altering the main codebase.
